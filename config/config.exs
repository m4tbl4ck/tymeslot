# Use Jason for JSON parsing in Phoenix
config :phoenix, :json_library, Jason

# Parameter names whose values are replaced with "[FILTERED]" before Phoenix or
# LiveView writes them to a log line. The match is a case-sensitive substring of
# the parameter key, so "password" also covers "current_password" and
# "new_password", "secret" covers "client_secret", and "token" covers
# "access_token", "refresh_token" and "bot_token".
#
# Setting this replaces Phoenix's own default of ["password", "token"], so both
# have to be repeated here. The additions are the credential names this app
# posts that neither of those words reaches: "api_key" (MiroTalk and the
# other key-authenticated video providers), "webhook_url" (a Slack incoming
# webhook URL is itself the credential), and "custom_meeting_url" (a personal
# meeting link routinely carries its own room key in a "?pwd=" parameter, so
# the webhook reasoning applies to it unchanged).
#
# "value" is here for a different reason. A LiveView `phx-blur` push carries
# the focused element's own value under that fixed key, whatever the field is
# called, so a secret input that validates on blur sends its plaintext under
# "value" rather than under its own name. The key is generic by construction
# and cannot be narrowed, so it is filtered wholesale; nothing this app logs
# needs to read it.
#
# This lives in compile-time config rather than runtime.exs so it holds at every
# log level and in every environment. Production pins the level to :info, where
# the "Parameters:" line is not emitted at all, but dev runs at :debug and a
# deployment raising the level must not start logging whatever an organiser
# typed into a connect form.
